                <h2> What is the purpose of JWTs and how does it work. </h2>
                <p> The purpose of JWTs is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.
                    JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>
